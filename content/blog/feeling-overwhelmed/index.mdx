You may feel overwhelmed to keep up with the speed of technology changes as a software engineer. But itâ€™s perfectly fine to not know everything. Software development is a complex and broad. No one can undertstand everything. Instead of focusing on things you don't know, focus on things you need to know to do your job.

Most of the technology that you need to know to do the job can be learned as you go. You can learn new ideas faster if you understand the underlying concept. A new framework is just another variation of the same concept. I used to think that you have to master the subject first before you can do the actual job. The reality is, you became a master after you do the job.
