In case you're curious, here's what I use to get my work done.

* Keychron K2.
* Logitech MX Master 2S.

## Development
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) theme and [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font.
